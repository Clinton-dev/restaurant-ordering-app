- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla javascript
- [fontawesome](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/font-awesome) - Fontawesome icons


### What I learned
- Implementing Dry principles, when ever I found myself repeating the same code I choose to write a function which I can call thus making the code modular
- Proper naming of variable names such as using prefix is for a boolean kind of variable

## Acknowledgments

- All this wouldn't have been possible if it were not from the knowledge passed from tutors at [scrimba](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwiR-eK3n8z6AhVRsaQKHcIfClUQFnoECBYQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fscrimba.com%2Fabout&usg=AOvVaw1LGuR5RjRSUYOF1gxZtpwO)
